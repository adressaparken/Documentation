**SECTION 1 – TECHNICAL RESPONSIBILITIES**

**Electrical and Other Appliances**

The power in Norway is 230V generally distributed through [shucko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuko) plugs. Electrical equipment provided by guests should comply with local requirements and be inspected prior to installation.

Any equipment installed in public space should be in accord to local universal access regulations.

**Rigging Operations**

In all instances pertaining to rigging safety, Adressaparken’s technical personnel is responsible for determining appropriate measures to be taken. Any person undertaking any rigging at Adressaparken must hold a certificate of competency appropriate to the skill level required as issued by a recognised authority and/or have experience in this type of operation. Only rigging devices engineered, certified and rated for the task may be employed.

Any rigging to be done outside of the park area will depend on permits from local authorities.

**Media Equipment**

All media equipment available onsite is listed below in this document and free for use by guests. On dealing with sound installations in the park, care must be taken so it doesn't disrupt the nearby activities.

**Security**

The sandbox media infrastructure at Adressaparken is completely open in local network. Care must be taken on creating access points that could be potentially misused by the public.

**Working procedures**

The server running in the control room is the gateway for all communications in the park and it is also responsible for storing and presenting all the sensor data to the web. We strongly advise against using this if not strictly necessary.

Changelogs must be kept as appropriate so system can be reset after guest visits. We do also recommend system backups to be made before guests commencing development in the local machines.

# How to create good content

The video screen at Adressaparken is built in portrait mode at 0.96 x 2.88m. It is important to note that it has much lower gamma than a normal computer screen, meaning it is not able to render subtle differences in colour. Also any content created for the screen should consider the size of the screen and the pixel pitch, meaning that it is best designed to be viewed from a fair distance.

#### Successful content would be / have

* Pixel perfect
* Contrasting colours
* Consider viewing distance and screen size
* Avoid big areas of bright colours, becomes too bright and unpleasant, specially when its dark outside
* Slow movement is best, fast content moving across the big area can be disorienting
{% endhint %}

#### In case it is necessary to re-scale content to fit

* Avoid small details and thin lines, these would most likely get lost
* Avoid aliasing on graphics and type

### How export an image to show in Photoshop \(or simulate the low resolution image\)

* Go to .... \[rescaling standar procedure folder\]

There are no formulas that would work for any kind of content when resizing. It is worth playing with the scaling algorithms inside photoshop. \(rescaling algorithms folder\)

### Some ideas to remediate unsuited content 

* If possible, choose a small section of the content that works when scaled up
* Use a levels adjustment layer to increase black level and enhance back small line detail  \[thicken lines folder\]
* Try using minimum filter to make lines thicker \[thicken lines folder\]
* With simple line drawings or similar, could you fill the shape outlines with solid color?
